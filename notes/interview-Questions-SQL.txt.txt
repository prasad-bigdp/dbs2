3. Difference between CHAR and VARCHAR data types.
CHAR: Fixed-length character data type where the storage size is predefined. Trailing spaces are padded to reach the defined length.
VARCHAR: Variable-length character data type where the storage size depends on the actual data length. No padding of spaces is done.
4. Explain the differences between SQL and MySQL?
SQL

MySQL

It is a structured query language that manages the relational database management system.

It is a relational database management system that uses SQL.

It is not an open-source language.

MySQL is an open-source platform. It allows access to anyone.

A database object that has no value is called view. Rows and columns exist in a view. A view is virtual table. it is created by combining one or more tables. The difference of a view and a table is that views are definition that build on other tables. If the underlying table changes, the View will also reflect those same changes.

The below syntax is used to create a view.

Syntax:

CREATE VIEW view_name AS    

SELECT columns    

FROM tables    

[WHERE conditions];

45. What are Access Control Lists?
A list of permissions known as an Access Control List is connected to an object. It is MySQL server security model helps in troubleshooting issues like users being unable to connect. MySQL holds the ACL’s cached in memory. ACL’s also called grant tables. MySQL verifies the authentication data and permissions against the ACLs. It predetermined order whenever a user tries to log in or execute a command.

Normalization is used to avoid duplication and redundancy. it is a process of organizing data. There are many normal forms of normalization. which are also called successive levels. The first three regular forms are sufficient.

First Normal Form (1NF): There are no repeating groups within rows.

Second Normal form(2NF): Value of every supporting column depending on the whole primary key.

Third Normal Form(3NF): It depends only on the primary key and no other value of non-key column.

47. What are various ways to create an index?
There are many options to create an index as below:

T-SQL statements can be used to create an index.
The SQL Server Management Studio is available for use. we can use this to browse to the table where the index will be created, and then right-click on the Indexes node. We must select the New Index option over here.
We can identify the index indirectly by specifying the PRIMARY KEY and the UNIQUE constraint in the CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement.
48. What are a clustered index and a non clustered index?
Cluster Index: An index type used to arrange data in a table is called a clustered index. The table’s data are stored in a specific order based on the clustered index.

Non Cluster Index: A non-clustered index is also a type of index used to organize data in a table. The table’s data are not stored in a specific order based on the non clustered index.

For more details, Check our latest article on Difference between Clustered and Non-clustered index.

49. How to validate emails using a single query?
We can use the regular expressions function (REGEXP_LIKE) to validate emails. Below is the example of validate emails using a single query.

SELECT

Email

FROM

Vehicle

where NOT REGEXP_LIKE(Email, ‘[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+.[A-Z]{2,4}’, ‘i’);

50. How can you handle the –secure-file-priv in MySQL?
The MySQL Server is restricted from loading directories using the LOAD DATA INFILE command by the -secure-file-priv option. Use the SHOW VARIABLES LIKE “secure_file_priv” command to view the directory that has been configured.

There are two options to handle as below.

Either transfer your file to the directory that secure-file-priv specifies.
Or you can turn off secure-file-priv. This must be removed at the beginning and cannot be disabled later.
